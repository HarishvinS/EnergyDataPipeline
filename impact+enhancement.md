# AI/ML Integration Plan - Energy Data Pipeline

## AI/ML Opportunities

### Forecasting

Next-Hour Prediction: Use lag_1, lag_24, rolling_mean_4 with Random Forest
Daily Peak Forecasting: Use rolling_max_24, hour, is_weekend patterns
Weekly Planning: Use month, year, seasonal trends

### Anomaly Detection

Real-Time Outliers: Isolation Forest on pct_change, rolling_std_4
Performance Degradation: Change point detection on rolling_mean_24
Equipment Failures: Statistical process control on extreme pct_change

### Automated Reporting

Daily Summaries: GPT-4 generates reports from aggregated statistics
Performance Insights: Extract patterns from plant_mean_ratio, source_mean_ratio
Threshold Alerts: Automated notifications when metrics exceed bounds

## User Impact

### Asset Performance Analyst

Automated anomaly detection saves 2+ hours daily
GPT summaries enable analysis of 10+ plants simultaneously
Forecasting optimizes maintenance scheduling

### Operations Manager

Real-time alerts prevent revenue loss from equipment issues
Performance benchmarking identifies underperforming assets
Automated reporting reduces manual work by 70%

### Energy Trader

Next-hour forecasting improves bid accuracy
Pattern recognition optimizes dispatch scheduling
Historical analysis informs capacity planning

## Technical Integration

### Pipeline Architecture

Raw CSV → Pipeline → processed_dataset.csv → AI Models → Insights/Alerts

### Key Models

#### Anomaly Detection

Input: pct_change, rolling_std_4, source_mean_ratio
Model: Isolation Forest
Output: Anomaly scores, instant alerts for scores > 0.8

#### Generation Forecasting

Input: lag_1, lag_24, hour, dayofweek, is_weekend
Model: Random Forest + LSTM ensemble
Output: 1-24 hour predictions with confidence intervals

#### Report Generation

Input: Daily aggregated statistics, anomaly summaries
Model: GPT-4 API with structured prompts
Output: Role-based markdown reports

## Automation Strategy

### Triggers

Daily: 6 AM automated processing
Real-time: New data uploads trigger pipeline
Threshold: Anomaly scores > 0.8 trigger alerts
Manual: On-demand analysis capability

### Outputs

Dashboard: Real-time anomaly scores and forecasts
Alerts: Email/Slack for critical issues
Reports: Automated daily/weekly summaries
API: Endpoints for external system integration
